A python wrapper was developed to execute mulitple software tools to complete the analysis of Human cytomegalovirus, abbreviated HCMV. Two patient donors were compared two and six days post infection. Methods used include converting transcriptomes to paired-end fastq files, using kallisto, sleuth, Bowtie2, SPAdes, as well as Python for a few calculations and putting together the whole pipeline.

What to have installed:
Unix: kallisto, Bowtie2, SPAdes, Blast+
Rstudio: sleuth package, dplyr package
Python: Biopython-import Entrez and SeqIO; import os to run unix commands
